The arguments correspond to the properties on AboutDialog. If the application has a Drawer, consider using AboutListTile instead of calling this directly. If you do not need an about box in your application, you should at least provide an affordance to call showLicensePage. The licenses shown on the LicensePage are those returned by the LicenseRegistry API, which can be used to add more licenses to the list. The context, useRootNavigator, routeSettings and anchorPoint arguments are passed to showDialog, the documentation for which discusses how it is used.',
